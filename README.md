## Background
After participating in Ludum Dare 46, I challenged myself to port my entry to as many consoles as I could using various homebrew libraries. The game is a simple platformer where you launch an egg between platforms to avoid falling in lava. The code was written in 72 hours so it isn't perfect, but I decided to provide the source regardless to hopefully help anyone interested in making games for these platforms. Feel free to ask any questions if you need anything to be clarified!


## Compiling
### Windows
#### raylib 
After installing [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases), execute ``make`` in the ``/raylib`` directory.
#### SDL2 
Tested with msys2. Install the `SDL2`, `SDL2_image`, `SDL2_mixer` and `SDL2_ttf` packages with `pacman`, then execute `make` in the windows/sdl2 folder. Finally, copy the resources folder to the output executable location.
### PS Vita
Compiling for PS Vita requires vitasdk. Then, execute ``cmake .&& make`` in the ``/psvita`` directory.
### Nintendo DS
NightFox's Lib does not need to be downloaded as it is already integrated into this repository, but you'll need to install the libnds libraries with [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started). Then, run the ``compile.bat`` script in ``/nds``.
### Wii
Compiling for Wii requires the libogc libraries that can be installed with [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started). You will also need [GRRLIB](https://github.com/GRRLIB/GRRLIB). Then, execute ``make`` in the ``/wii`` directory.
### GameCube
Compiling for GameCube requires the same libogc libraries from [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) but a different fork of GRRLIB that can be found [here](https://github.com/capz/GRRLIB). Then, execute ``make`` in the ``/gamecube`` directory.
### Original Xbox
Clone [this fork of nxdk](https://github.com/dracc/nxdk/tree/xgu) directly next to the Terri-Fried folder, then [install the nxdk prerequisites](https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk/wiki/Getting-Started). Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Voxel9/xbox-xgu-examples#quick-guide) to fix the XGU headers in nxdk. This is a temporary fix for some duplicate symbol linker errors.  
Now `cd` to the `Terri-fried/xbox` folder and run `make`. An XBE file should be built in the `bin` folder. Copy the contents of the `bin` folder to your Xbox and run `default.xbe`.
### Nintendo Switch
Requires devkitpro, devkitARM, libNX and the following packages to be installed via dkp-pacman:  
`switch-pkg-config`, `switch-SDL2`, `switch-SDL2_mixer`, `switch-SDL2_image` `switch-SDL2_ttf`  
Once installed, `cd` to `Terri-Fried/switch` and run `make`. Copy the resulting NRO file over to your Switch's microSD card in the `switch` folder and launch via nx-hbmenu.
### 3DS
Compiling for 3DS requires `citro2d`, `citro3d`, `3DS-sdl`, `3DS-sdl-mixer`, `3ds-libvorbisidec`, `libctru`, `3ds-libogg`, `3ds-libmad`,
`3ds-mikmod`, `3ds-zlib` from [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started). To compile a .3dsx file, execute ``make`` in the ``/3ds`` directory,
or run the ``compile.bat`` script. To compile a cia file, execute ``make cia`` in the ``/3ds`` directory, or run the ``compile cia.bat`` script.
## Contributing
Feel free to create a fork of this repository if you want to port the game to additional platforms! The code can also be used for any other noncommercial purposes.
